## Notebooks

There are 3 types of Notebook:
- for testing the model (training)
- for performing some EDA and preproc
- for testing the requests to Spoonacular API to get nutrition facts.


For the notebook "patriciaitsantos_model", it has been run with google colab to:
- connect to our google cloud bucket
- use the google gpu as it is needed for the pre trained model.
